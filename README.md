# Polarith AI

![](polarith-ai.png)

[Polarith AI](http://polarith.com/ai/) is a comprehensive system for
creating autonomously moving characters for your game or simulation. Being the
result of years of research, AI experience and intense development, it uses new
context steering algorithms to overcome the issues and difficulties classic
steering approaches suffer from.

This repository belongs to the official
[Unity plugin](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/71465).
It contains additional content you will find useful if you want to write your
own behaviours. So if you want to extent the plugin to your needs, have a closer
look at the source code we publish here and learn how easy behaviours can be
implemented using the incredibly flexible context steering approach.

**All sources require Unity and the plugin Polarith AI in order to work
properly.**
